* Taskbot

  Taskbot is a task manager IRC Bot written in Common Lisp.

*** Getting started
    Taskbot has as requirements [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-irc/][cl-irc]] and [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-sqlite/][cl-sqlite]]. Both are
    avalaible via [[http://www.quicklisp.org/][quicklisp]] and it is the recommended way to install
    it.

    Get the taskbot source with
    : git clone https://davazp@github.com/davazp/taskbot.git

    The first time you run taskbot you will need edit config.lisp to
    set settings as the IRC server, the default prefix character, and
    so. Then, start your lisp implementation, load the taskbot system
    and initialize the database with:

    #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
    (asdf:load-system :taskbot)
    (taskbot:setup)
    #+END_SRC

    It will ask you some information. Finally, you can start taskbot with
    : (taskbot:start)

*** Introduction

    Taskbot is a command driven bot. It accepts commands from both
    private messages and channel messages. Commands may be prefixed in
    several ways as:
    : ,command
    and
    : taskbot: command

    You *must* prefix your command if you ask it in an IRC channel
    indeed of privately. You can configure the prefix character in the
    config.lisp file.

    An important command is =help=. It will show you help about a
    command. If the argument is ommited, then it will list the
    commands avalaible for you.

***** The tracker
      The taskbot main entity is the ticket. You can create a new
      ticket with
      : ,add <task description>

      Also you can list the open tickets with
      : ,list

      The tickets are contextual. Namely, taskbot records where you
      create it. So =list= in a channel =#a= will list the open
      tickets for the channel =#a=.

      You can mark the ticket #N as finished with
      : ,done N

***** Permissions
      Taskbot provides different categories of users: /undesirable/,
      /nobody/, /user/ and /admin/. By default, an user is a 'nobody'.
      The granted permissions to each category is inclusive. In other
      words, each category adds priviledges to the previous ones. The
      lowest category /undesirable/ is special. Taskbot will ignore
      every request of /undesirable/ users. Register an user as
      /undesirable/ to ban it.
